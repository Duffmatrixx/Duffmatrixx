Hi, I'm a director and artist working with circus as a starting point. During the 2010's I was a director for the company Cirkus Cirk√∂r where my productions played over 600 times for a worldwide audience.

In secret, I became increasingly interested in and involved in the crypto community where I got lost somewhere near the forest edge of the dark forest. There I've become the founder and artistic co-worker at the company Saloranta & de Vylder as well as one of the initiators of The Sphere.

Today I'm looking for something that can lead me back, or forward, or anywhere.
